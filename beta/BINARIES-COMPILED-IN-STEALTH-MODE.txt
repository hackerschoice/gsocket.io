All static compiled binaries are compiled with --enable-stealth and UPX packed when
possible. Some command line options are not available in stealth mode:

There is no -h, -m option (help & manpage) and -s (secret) is mandatory. 
Otherwise gs-netcat will execute uname -a and exit immediately.

Try any of this:

./gs-netcat -s MySecret -il
GSOCKET_SECRET='-s MySecret' ./gs-netcat -li
GSOCKET_SECRET='-s MySecret -il' ./gs-netcat

or start as a daemon in the backgroun with the fake process name 'cached':

(bash -c "GSOCKET_ARGS='-s MySecret -il' exec -a cached ./gs-netcat &>/dev/null" &)

And clever people then rm -rf ./gs-netcat.
